# Rubik's Cube Solver - CENG303 Term Project (Written in Java)
A term project to solve a 2x2x2 Rubik's cube. <br>
We used BFS algorithm to solve the scrambled cube. <br>
The algorithm allows the user to rotate the cube as desired by taking a set of rotation inputs. <br>
## How to Run
You can use the source code to run the program or you can use cmd to run it with jar file using command: java -jar RubikCubeSolver.jar

## Screenshots from the Algorithm
+ The algorithm prints the cube after every rotation to show the user current state: <br>

+ If given an invalid input, it gives an error: <br>

+ If the cube is already in a solved state after the user inputs, the output is: <br>

+ After the input phase is done, it prints the rotation sequence to solve the cube: <br>
